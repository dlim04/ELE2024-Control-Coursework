    We used a GitHub repository to collaborate on writing code. We used the git issue tracker to keep track of the tasks. This issue tracker was critical as it allowed us to see how the tasks were assigned and how those tasks were progressing. We distributed the tasks on an initial call where we took problems that we felt confident with. These changed as we went on and might have found some problems tougher than we expected. Regular communication was the key to ensuring we were all aware of the progress on projects. The link to the issue tracker can be found  \href{https://github.com/drlim2u/ELE2024-Control-Coursework/issues}{here}.
