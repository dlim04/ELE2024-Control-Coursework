\subsection*{D2}
    \subsubsection*{Communication} We communicated clearly and regularly. This meant we were all aware of the progress of the coursework and what remained to be done. 
    \subsubsection*{Organisation} We began early and kept on top of our work. This was important as work from other modules began to pile up nearing the end of Semester 1. Having an issue tracker was key to the organisation behind the project.
    \subsubsection*{Education} When one person was struggling with a part of the coursework, or didn't understand the method behind a solution, we were able to explain our understandings of it. This definitely helps with our understanding of the theory from this module going forward.
