\subsection*{Problem B3}
    A simulation was run to determine the impulse response and the step response of the transfer of the linearised system. This simulation was written in Python for which the code can be found \href{https://github.com/drlim2u/ELE2024-Control-Coursework/blob/059953dc7b2d8ba0a86b6f437153ceb4442b7a60/PartB.py#L59}{here} and which produced the Figure \ref{fig:problem_b3} below.
