\subsection*{Problem B4}
    \hfill \break
    A simulation was run to determine the low-frequency and high-frequency asymptotes of the magnitude and phase lag of the transfer function of the linearised system. This simulation was written in Python for which the code can be found \href{https://github.com/drlim2u/ELE2024-Control-Coursework/blob/059953dc7b2d8ba0a86b6f437153ceb4442b7a60/PartB.py#L125}{here} and which produced the Figure \ref{fig:problem_b4} below.
