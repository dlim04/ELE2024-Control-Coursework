\subsection*{Given Equations} The following equations were given by Dr P. Soposakis as part of the coursework brief:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
    L = L_0 + L_1 e(-\alpha y)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:2}
    F_{mag}=c \frac{I^2}{y^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    y = \delta - x
    \end{equation}
This is the equation that we have used:\\
